# m_pine for lbdb v0.9 by Gabor Fleischer <flocsy@mtesz.hu>
#
# Two variabled can be set in lbdbrc: PINERC, PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS
# Here comes the explanation what are they for:
# 1. First I look for $PINERC. If not set, then I use my defaults:
#    PINERC="/etc/pine.conf /etc/pine.conf.fixed .pinerc"
#    If you don't want me to look in the default PINERCs, then set PINERC=no
# 2. I make a list of all the addressbooks in the PINERCs.
# 3. Then the $PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS are added to this list.
# 4. And if this list is still empty then add the default addressbooks:
#    PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS="/etc/addressbook .addressbook"
# 5. Make the query in the listed addressbooks
#
# Changelog:
# 0.9: Convert Quoted-Printable in the real names into plain 8bit.
# 0.8: When the 'real name' is missing, put " " there, so mutt works fine.
# 0.7: Fixed bugs:
#	* Search was case sensitive. Now it's insensitive.
#	* Lines with missing fields (i.e."nick<tab><tab>addr") were broken.
#	* Default didn't work if address-books in pinercs were "".
# 0.6: The .addressbook format's multi-line addresses are supported.
# 0.5: Initial release.
