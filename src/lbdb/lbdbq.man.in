.SH NAME
lbdbq \- query program for the little brother's database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lbdbq
.I something
.br
.B lbdbq
.RB [ -v | --version | -h | --help ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lbdbq
is the client program for the little brother's database. It will
attempt to invoke various modules to gather information about persons
matching
.IR something .
E.g., it may look at a list of addresses from which you have received
mail, it may look at YP maps, or it may try to finger
.IR something @ "<various hosts>" .
.PP
The behavior is configurable: Upon startup, 
.B lbdbq
will source the shell scripts:
.RS
.I @sysconfdir@/lbdb.rc
.br
.I $HOME/.lbdbrc
.br
.I $HOME/.lbdb/lbdbrc
.br
.I $HOME/.lbdb/rc
.RE
if they exist.
.PP
They can be used to set the following global variables:
.TP
.B MODULES_PATH
a space separated list of directories, where 
.B lbdbq
should look for modules.
.TP
.B METHODS
a space separated list of the modules to use.
.TP
.B SORT_OUTPUT
If you set this to 
.I false
or 
.IR no ,
lbdbq won't sort the addresses but returns them in reverse order
(which means that the most recent address in m_inmail database is
first). If you set this to 
.IR name ,
lbdbq sorts the output by real name.  If you set this to 
.IR comment ,
it sort the output by the comment (for example the date in 
.BR m_inmail ).
.I reverse_comment
realizes the same as 
.IR comment ,
but in reverse order, so the most recent timestamp of m_inmail may be
on top. If you set SORT_OUTPUT to
.IR address ,
lbdbq sorts the output by addresses (that's the default).
.TP
.B KEEP_DUPES
If you set this to
.I true
or
.IR yes ,
lbdbq won't remove duplicate addresses with different real name
comment fields.
.PP
Note that there 
.I are
defaults, so you should most
probably modify these variables using constructs like this:
.nf
       MODULES_PATH="$MODULES_PATH $HOME/lbdb_modules"
.fi
.PP
Additionally, modules may have configuration variables of
their own.
.SH MODULES
Currently, the following modules are supplied with lbdb:
.TP
.B m_finger
This module will use finger to find out something more about a person.
The list of hosts do be asked is configurable; use the 
.B M_FINGER_HOSTS
variable. Note that "localhost" will mean an invocation of your local
.BR finger (1)
binary, and should thus work even if you don't provide the finger
service to the network.
.B m_finger
tries to find out the machines mail domain name in
.IR /etc/mailname ,
by parsing a
.I sendmail.cf
file (if it finds one) and by reading
.I /etc/hostname
and
.IR /etc/HOSTNAME .
If you know that this fails on your machine, or you want to force lbdbq
to consider some other name to be the local mail domain name (misconfigured
SUNs come to mind here), you can specify a name using the
.B MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME
variable. If this variable is set by you, no probing will be done by
.BR lbdbq .
.TP
.B m_inmail
This module will look up user name fragments in a list of mail
addresses created by
.BR lbdb-fetchaddr (1).
.TP
.B m_passwd
This module searches for matching entries in your local /etc/passwd
file. It evaluates the local machine mail domain in the same way 
.B m_finger
does.  If you set
.BR PASSWD_IGNORESYS=true ,
this module ignores all system accounts and only finds UIDs between
1000 and 29999 (all other UIDs are reserved on a Debian system).
.TP
.B m_yppasswd
This module searches for matching entries in the NIS password database
using the command ``ypcat passwd''.
.TP
.B m_nispasswd
This module searches for matching entries in the NIS+ password database
using the command ``niscat passwd.org_dir''.
.TP
.B m_getent
This module searches for matching entries in whatever password
database is configured using the command ``getent passwd''.
.TP
.BR m_pgp2 ", " m_pgp5 ", " m_gpg
These modules scan your PGP 2.*, PGP 5.* or GnuPG public key ring for
data. They use the programs
.BR pgp (1),
.BR pgpk (1),
or
.BR gpg (1)
to get the data.
.TP
.BR m_fido
This module searches your Fido nodelist, stored in
.I $HOME/.lbdb/nodelist
created by
.BR nodelist2lbdb (1).
.TP
.BR m_abook
This module uses the program
.BR abook (1),
a text based address book application to search for addresses.  You
can define multiple abook address books by setting the variable
.B ABOOK_FILES
to a space separated list.
.TP
.BR m_addr_email
This module uses the program
.BR addr-email (1),
a text based frontend to the Tk 
.BR addressbook (1)
application.
.TP
.BR m_muttalias
This module searches the variable
.B MUTTALIAS_FILES
(a space separated list) of files in 
.B MUTT_DIRECTORY
that contain mutt aliases.  File names without leading slash will have
.B MUTT_DIRECTORY
(defaults to 
.BI $HOME /.mutt
or
.BR $HOME ,
if
.BI $HOME /.mutt
does not exist) prepended before the file name.  Absolute file names
(beginning with 
.IR / )
will be taken direct.
.TP
.BR m_pine
This module searches
.BR pine (1)
addressbook files for aliases.  To realize this it first inspects the
variable
.BR PINERC .
If it isn't set, the default 
.RI ` "/etc/pine.conf /etc/pine.conf.fixed .pinerc" '
is used.  To suppress inspecting the
.B PINERC
variable, set it to
.IR no .
It than takes all 
.B address-book
and
.B global-address-book
entries from these pinerc files and adds the contents of the variable
.B PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS
to the list, which defaults to
.RI ` "/etc/addressbook .addressbook" '.
Then these addressbooks are searched for aliases.  All filenames
without leading slash are searched in
.BR $HOME .
.TP
.BR m_palm
This module searches the Palm address database using the 
.BR Palm::PDB (3pm)
and
.BR Palm::Address (3pm)
Perl modules from CPAN.
It searches in the variable
.B PALM_ADDRESS_DATABASE
or if this isn't set in 
.IR $HOME/.jpilot/AddressDB.pdb .
.TP
.BR m_gnomecard
This module searches for addresses in your GnomeCard database files.
The variable 
.B GNOMECARD_FILES
is a whitespace separated list of GnomeCard data files.  If this
variable isn't defined, the module searches in
.BI $HOME /.gnome/GnomeCard
for the GnomeCard database or at least falls back to
.BI $HOME /.gnome/GnomeCard.gcrd\fR.
If a filename does not start with a slash, it is prefixed with
.BR $HOME/ .
.TP
.BR m_bbdb
This module searches for addresses in your (X)Emacs BBDB (big brother
database).  It doesn't access ~/.bbdb directly (yet) but calls
.BR emacs (1)
or
.BR xemacs (1)
with a special mode to get the information (so don't expect too much
performance in this module).  You can configure the
.B EMACS
variable to tell this module which emacsen to use.  Otherwise it will
fall back to 
.B emacs
or
.BR xemacs.
.TP
.BR m_ldap
This module queries an LDAP server using the 
.BR Net::LDAP (3pm)
Perl modules from CPAN.  It can be configured using an external
resource file 
.I @sysconfdir@/lbdb_ldap.rc
You can explicity define a LDAP query in this file or you can use one
or more of the predefined queries from the 
.B %ldap_server_db
in this file.  For this you have to define a space separated list of
nicknames from entries in the variable
.BR LDAP_NICKS .
.TP
.BR m_wanderlust
This module searches for addresses stored in your
.I $WANDERLUST_ADDRESSES 
(or by default in 
.IR $HOME/.addresses )
file, an addressbook of
.BR WanderLust .
.TP
.BR m_osx_addressbook
This module queries the OS X AddressBook.  It is only available on OS
X systems.
.TP
.BR m_evolution
This module queries the Ximian Evolution address book.  It depends on
the program
.BR evolution-addressbook-export ,
which is shipped with evolution.
.TP
.BR m_vcf
This module uses libvformat to search for addresses from the
space\-separated set of vCard files defined in
.IR $VCF_FILES .
.PP
Feel free to create your own modules to query other database resources,
YP maps, and the like.
.B m_finger
should be a good example of how to do it.
.PP
If you create your own modules or have other changes and feel that
they could be helpful for others, don't hesitate to submit them to the 
author for inclusion in later releases.
.PP
Finally, to use
.B lbdbq
from mutt, add the following line to your
.I $HOME/.muttrc:
.nf
    set query_command="lbdbq %s"
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v | --version"

.SH CREDITS
Most of the really interesting code of this program (namely, the RFC
822 address parser used by lbdb-fetchaddr) was stolen from Michael
Elkins' mutt mail user agent. Additional credits go to Brandon Long
for putting the query functionality into mutt.
