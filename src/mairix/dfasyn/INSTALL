There is no real configure mechanism (yet).

To build the program

    make

To install the program (perhaps as root)

    make prefix=/usr/local install

or as yourself you might do

    make prefix=$HOME install

or if your distribution puts manpages in /usr/share/man, you might do

    make prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/share/man install

# vim:et:sw=4
