METHODS="m_inmail m_passwd m_finger"


#
# If you want m_finger to ask other host then localhost, create a list here:
# (a space separated list):
#
#M_FINGER_HOSTS="master.debian.org va.debian.org localhost"

#
# If it isn't possible to find out the correct mail domain name of
# your system in /etc/mailname, by reading sendmail.cf, /etc/hostname
# or /etc/HOSTNAME, you can specify it in the variable
# MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME. This overrides all other mechanisms.
#
#MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME=does-not-exist.org

# - m_muttalias      query set of mutt alias files:
#
# Set MUTTALIAS_FILES below to list of files in MUTT_DIRECTORY that
# contain mutt aliases. File names without leading slash will have
# $MUTT_DIRECTORY (defaults to $HOME/.mutt or $HOME, if ~/.mutt does
# not exist) prepended before the file name. Absolute file names
# (beginning with /) will be taken direct.
#
#MUTT_DIRECTORY="$HOME/.mutt"
#MUTTALIAS_FILES=".muttrc .mail_aliases muttrc aliases"


# - m_pine	search pine addressbook files for aliases:
#
# This module first inspects the variable PINERC. If it isn't set, the
# default `/etc/pine.conf /etc/pine.conf.fixed .pinerc' is used. To
# suppress inspecting the PINERC variable, set it to "no". It than
# takes all address-book and global-address-book entries from these
# pinerc files and adds the contents of the variable PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS
# to the list, which defaults to `/etc/addressbook .addressbook'. Then
# these addressbooks are searched for aliases. All filenames without
# leading slash are searched in $HOME.
#
#PINERC="/etc/pine.conf /etc/pine.conf.fixed .pinerc"
#PINE_ADDRESSBOOKS="/etc/addressbook .addressbook"


# - m_wanderlust      search your WanderLust addresses files:
#
# Set WANDERLUST_ADDRESSES below to point to your WanderLust address
# book.  If you don't set this variable, the default
# ($HOME/.addresses) is used.
#
#WANDERLUST_ADDRESSES="$HOME/.addresses"


# - m_palm	search your Palm addressbook file:
#
# This module searches the Palm address database using the Palm::PDB
# and Palm::Address Perl modules from CPAN. It searches in the
# variable PALM_ADDRESS_DATABASE or if this isn't set in
# $HOME/.jpilot/AddressDB.pdb.
#
#PALM_ADDRESS_DATABASE="$HOME/.jpilot/AddressDB.pdb"


# - m_gnomecard	 search your GnomeCard address database files.
#
# This module searches for addresses in your GnomeCard database files.
# The variable GNOMECARD_FILES is a whitespace separated list of
# GnomeCard data files. If this variable isn't defined, the module
# searches in $HOME/.gnome/GnomeCard for the GnomeCard database or at
# least falls back to $HOME/.gnome/GnomeCard.gcrd. If a filename does
# not start with a slash, it is prefixed with $HOME/.
#
#GNOMECARD_FILES="$HOME/.gnome/GnomeCard.gcrd"


# - m_bbdb  search your BBDB (big brother database).
#
# This module searches for addresses in your (X)Emacs BBDB (big
# brother database). It doesn't access ~/.bbdb directly (yet) but
# calls emacs(1) or xemacs(1) with a special mode to get the
# information (so don't expect too much performance in this module).
# You can configure the EMACS variable to tell this module which
# emacsen to use. Otherwise it will fall back to emacs or xemacs.
#
#EMACS="emacs"


# - m_ldap  query an LDAP server.
#
# This module queries an LDAP server using the Net::LDAP Perl modules
# from CPAN. It can be configured using an external resource file. You
# can explicity define a LDAP query in this file or you can use one or
# more of the predefined queries from the %ldap_server_db in this
# file. For this you have to define the selected enties as a space
# separated list in the the variable LDAP_NICKS.
#
#LDAP_NICKS="debian bigfoot"


# - m_abook query the abook(1) programm
#
# if you have more than one abook addressbook, use the ABOOK_FILES
# variable. It contains a space separated list of all your files. 
# Default is $HOME/.abook/addressbook $HOME/.abook.addressbook
# ABOOK_FILES="$HOME/.abook/friends $HOME/.abook/work"


# - m_passwd search in /etc/passwd
#
# On a Debian system only the UIDs 1000-29999 are used for normal
# users.  Setting PASSWD_IGNORESYS to "true" implies that lbdbq
# ignores and UID, which isn't in that range:
#PASSWD_IGNORESYS=true


# - m_vcf search in vcard files
#
# You have to define the vcard files space separated in $VCF_FILES to
# make this module work:
#VCF_FILES=$HOME/my.vcf


#
# If you want to use private modules set the MODULES_PATH to find them:
# (a space separated list):
#
#MODULES_PATH="/usr/lib/lbdb $HOME/.lbdb/modules"


#
# Do you want the output to be sorted?
# If you set this to "false" or "no", lbdbq won't sort the addresses
# but returns them in reverse order (which means that the most recent
# address in m_inmail database is first).
# If you set this to "name", lbdbq sorts the output by real name.
# If you set this to "comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment (column 3).
# If you set this to "reverse_comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment 
#                                       but with reverse order (column 3).
# If you set this to "address", lbdbq sorts the output by addresses
# (that's the default).
#
#SORT_OUTPUT=address

#
# Do you want to see duplicate mail addresses (with multiple real
# names or different comment fields)?  Default is "no".
#
#KEEP_DUPES=no
