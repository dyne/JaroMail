# INTRODUCTION

Jaro Mail is an integrated suite of interoperable tools for GNU/Linux
and Apple/OSX to manage e-mail communication in a private and efficient
way, without relying too much on on-line services, in fact encouraging
users to store e-mail locally.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, Jaro Mail reuses some existing free
and open source tools working since more than 10 years, generating
their configurations and setting up integrations automatically.

 executable | function
 ---------- | --------------------
  ZShell    | Scripting language
  Mutt      | Mail User Agent
  Fetchmail | Mail Transport (fetch)
  Vim       | Mail editor
  GnuPG     | Content encryption
  Mixmaster | Anonymous emails
  MSmtp     | Mail Transport (send)
  Notmuch   | Search engine
  ABook     | Addressbook
  Elinks    | HTML rendering

A round-up on Jaro Mail features follows:

![Jaro Mail functions diagram](http://files.dyne.org/jaromail/diagram.png)

* Minimalistic and efficient interface with message threading
* Targets intensive usage of e-mails and mailinglists
* Stores e-mails locally in a reliable format (maildir)
* Integrates whitelisting and blacklisting, local and remote
* Can do search and backup by advanced expressions
* Automatically generates filter rules (sieve)
* Imports and exports VCard contacts to addressbook
* Computes and shows statistics on mail traffic
* Encrypted password storage using OS native keyrings
* Advanced maildir tools (merge, backup, address extraction)
* Defers connections for off-line operations
* Checks SSL/TLS certificates when fetching and sending mails
* Supports strong encryption messaging (GnuPG)
* Can send anonymous emails (Mixmaster)
* Many languages! so exotic! such UTF-8!
* Multi platform: GNU/Linux/BSD, Apple/OSX
* Old school, used by its author for the past 10 years

# Build

Make sure you have installed the following dependencies on your operating system, they should be named in a similar way across distributions, here below the names of the packages are referring to those found in Devuan/Debian.

To build:
```
libglib2.0-dev libgnome-keyring-dev libxapian-dev libgmime-2.6-dev libtalloc-dev zlib1g-dev libgpgme11-dev
```
To run:
```
fetchmail msmtp neomutt notmuch pinentry-curses abook wipe
```

# INSTALL

If building and installing from Git source, please run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to initialize and clone the submodules used as part of Jaro Mail's tree.

Then compile and install all jaromail in a self-contained directory with one command:
```
   PREFIX=$HOME/Postbox make install
```

This will create the directory `Postbox` in your home directory and install
Jaro Mail inside it, with the `jaro` executable in `Postbox/bin`.

When Jaro Mail is installed system-wide, the `JAROMAILDIR`
environmental variable can be changed to point to where all emails
will be stored, by default it is `$HOME/Mail`.

Keep in mind **you need to read the Manual**: this software is not
graphical, it is not meant to be intuitive, does not contains
eyecandies (except for stats on mail traffic). Jaro Mail is operated
via Terminal, configured in plain text and overall made by geeks for
geeks.


**Apple/OSX** Jaro Mail 3q.0 has not yet been updated to Apple/OSX. With
  2.0 users can simply drag Jaro Mail into /Applications When started
  Jaro Mail opens a Terminal window preconfigured with its environment,
  to activate it for any terminal add this to `~/.profile`:
```
export PATH=/Applications/JaroMail.app/Contents/Resources/jaro/bin:$PATH
```

# USAGE MANUAL

For a brief overview see the commandline help:
```
 jaro -h
```
When in doubt, make sure you read the User's Manual, it is important.

Download the PDF: https://files.dyne.org/jaromail/jaromail-manual.pdf

Or browse online the latest version:
https://github.com/dyne/JaroMail/blob/master/doc/jaromail-manual.org

It is recommended that you read the user manual: you wonâ€™t get far unless you know what you are doing. Even for experienced Mutt users: keys will be familiar, but there are things to learn in the manual on how Jaro Mail redesigns the e-mail workflow for instance with whitelisting and remote sieve folders.
